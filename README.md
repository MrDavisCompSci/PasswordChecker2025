# Password checker	

Complete the checkPassword function so that it returns True if the password:

-  Is 8 characters long or longer
-  Has at least one capital letter
-  Has at least one lower case letter
-  Has at least one numeric character

The function should return False otherwise.

## Hints

-  Look up the built-in functions islower, isupper, isdigit and isalpha. 
-  Comparison operators work with characters - "A" < "Z" is True.
-  You can also use ord to get ASCII values: ord("c") returns 112.
